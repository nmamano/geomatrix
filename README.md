geomatrix
=========

In this project I explore a different approach to represent bidimensional matrixs of booleans using geometric properties.

It is a 3 phase project.

In the first phase (which is close to completion now):
I define precisely the API of geomatrix.
I develop algorithms to perform all those methods as efficiently as possible.
I make a GUI to be able to visualize and test the operations.

In the second phase:
I make alternative, more conventional implementations of other data structures that implement the same API.
I define formal criterions to determine how "appropiate" a matrix is to be represented with a Geomatrix.
I do efficiency tests based on these criteria for the Geomatrix and other data structures, to get a notion of the usefulness of Geomatrixs.

In the third phase:
I try to extend the notion of Geomatrix with 3D geometry to represent matrixs of integers instead of booleans.
